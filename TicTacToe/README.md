# TicTacToe (Client/Server)

Two small Python programs that let two players play Tic-Tac-Toe over TCP sockets:
- `server.py` hosts the game (Player O).
- `client.py` connects and plays against the server (Player #).

The board uses coordinates like A1, B3, etc. The server echoes the board after each move and announces win, lose, or tie.
