This project focuses on calculating the union volume of overlapping 3D rectangular prisms, improving performance through parallel processing, aggregating data using a MapReduce approach, and visualizing results in 3D.
The file pancakes.py computes the exact union volume of multiple overlapping 3D boxes using a sweep-line algorithm. The file parrallelpancakes.py estimates the union volume using a Monte Carlo simulation and leverages multiprocessing for better performance. The file mapper.py processes CSV data by calculating row averages and column sums, while reducer.py combines the results from multiple mapper outputs to compute overall means, medians, and column statistics. The file visual.py provides a 3D visualization of randomly generated boxes to validate the volume calculations.
To run the program for exact volume calculation, execute python3 pancakes.py and enter the number of boxes, accuracy, and coordinates when prompted. To estimate the volume using parallel processing, run python3 parrallelpancakes.py. For data aggregation, use the mapper by running python3 mapper.py input.csv output.csv and then combine the results with the reducer by executing python3 reducer.py output1.csv output2.csv .... To visualize the boxes and confirm bounding volumes, run python3 visual.py.

This project integrates geometry, parallel computing, MapReduce data processing, and 3D visualization into one cohesive assignment.
