This project is a Flask-based web application that manages courses, instructors, and enrollments using an SQLite database. It allows users to add new courses and instructors, view courses taught by a specific instructor, and display the top five courses in a department based on average enrollment. The application uses HTML templates to handle input forms and display results dynamically.
