This homework contains two Python programs. The first program, Expression.py, builds an expression tree from a postfix expression, converts it to infix form, and evaluates the result. The second program, Lines.py, reads a set of 2D line segments from the user and determines whether the lines form a closed shape. If the lines create a closed figure, it displays the number of sides; otherwise, it states that the lines do not form a closed figure.
